# My Discord Bot

Welcome to my Discord bot project! This bot is a side project that I've developed for my future portfolio. It's a fun experiment that I've been working on to learn more about programming and Discord bots.

## Features

- **Command Handling**: Currently the only way to run commands is using discords /commands, a bot prefix is in the works.
- **Fun Commands**: There are some fun commands like memes to entertain users.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the bot, follow these steps:

1. **Invite the Bot**: [Click here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1212571440386408558&permissions=380641598593&scope=bot+applications.commands) to invite the bot to your Discord server.
2. **Set Up**: Configure the bot with necessary permissions and roles.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this project, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes. (Although I might not accept it because I won't check this repo often and I like giving myself the challenge of writing everything myself) Here are some ways you can contribute:

- **Bug Fixes**: Help identify and fix any bugs or issues.
- **Feature Requests**: Suggest new features or improvements.
- **Documentation**: Enhance the README or provide better in-code documentation.
- **Code Optimization**: Improve the efficiency and readability of the codebase.

## Support

If you encounter any issues with the bot or have questions, you can join my public [discord server](https://discord.gg/WEErxAP8kz).
